1. Define Your Objective
Our objective is to make an app that allows people to discover new activities of their interest within a general area. We automate the process of finding something to do. 
Detail: Target audience : Everyone who wants to find a community, location, and general activity to be done in any location they please.
Common Mistakes: Failing to accurately gauge the market can lead to developing an app that lacks demand. Utilize surveys or focus groups as needed.

2. Conduct Market Research
Investigate existing apps similar to your concept.
Detail: Analyze competitor strengths and weaknesses, user reviews, and feature sets. Determine what gaps exist in the market that your app can fill.
Common Mistakes: Relying solely on assumptions without empirical data can jeopardize your app's potential. Document your findings in a report for reference.

3. Outline Features and Functions
List the core features your app will need to include.
Detail: Prioritize features for your Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which can be expanded upon later. Consider user journeys to understand how users will interact with each feature.
A button that asks you survey questions and follow-up questions that are then inputted into our trained API that searches to find a place to go based on your criteria. 
Map that you can circle an area and press the button to conduct the search and survey in that area
Under results, there will be buttons for “find food” This 
 Users make communities to gather people in their community based on their common activities and interests in the area 
Most popular places 
Common Mistakes: Trying to do too much too soon can affect development timelines. Limit your initial feature set to those that fulfill your primary objective.

4. Create Wireframes and Mockups
Visualize your app’s layout and flow through design tools.
Detail: Use tools like Sketch, Figma, or Adobe XD to create wireframes. Mockups should illustrate how users will navigate your app and interact with features.
Common Mistakes: Focusing only on aesthetics rather than usability can create a user experience that frustrates potential users. Prioritize user feedback on designs.

5. Set Up Development Tools
Choose the right tech stack and development tools.
Detail: If you're developing for iOS, ensure you have Xcode installed, as well as other relevant libraries and APIs. For backend, consider the server-side language (like Node.js or Python) based on your needs.
Common Mistakes: Ignoring scalability considerations during the tech selection process can manifest problems later. Choose robust tools that can grow with your app.

6. Begin Coding
Break down the coding tasks into smaller, manageable parts.
Detail: Follow an agile methodology, breaking the project into sprints. Leverage version control (like Git) to track changes and collaborate effectively, especially if working with a team.
Common Mistakes: Not incorporating testing throughout the coding process can lead to an accumulation of undetected bugs. Start implementing unit tests
from day one.

8. Develop the Backend and Database
Establish server and database functionalities.
Detail: Choose a database solution based on your app’s needs (SQL vs. NoSQL) and set up the backend to manage data effectively. Ensure you establish API protocols to connect the frontend and backend.
Common Mistakes: Overlooking data security and user privacy, especially if handling sensitive information, can lead to compliance issues. Implement security measures early.

9. Implement User Interface (UI) Design
Start developing the UI based on your mockups.
Detail: Convert wireframes into interactive designs focused on usability and aesthetics. Ensure navigation is intuitive, and incorporate user feedback into your design revisions.
Common Mistakes: Ignoring design guidelines set by platform standards (like Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines) can lead to rejection during the app review process.

10. Testing Phase
Conduct rigorous testing for bugs and usability issues.
Detail: Implement both manual and automated testing strategies, ensuring to cover all app functions, including edge cases. Gather user feedback through beta testing with a selected group.
Common Mistakes: Skipping user testing can result in launching unpolished features. Regularly refine the app based on gathered feedback.

11. Prepare for App Store Submission
Ensure compliance with regulatory and platform-specific guidelines.
Detail: Create an App Store Connect account, prepare app information (such as descriptions, screenshots, and marketing materials), and review Apple’s App Store Review Guidelines comprehensively.
Common Mistakes: Incomplete submissions can delay approval, so double-check all required fields and app compliance before submission.

12. Launch Your App
Promote your app through various channels.
Detail: Develop a marketing strategy that includes a social media campaign, press releases, blog posts, and possible promotional events to draw attention before and during the launch.
Common Mistakes: Assuming that the app will gain traction without any marketing efforts can lead to initial failures. Actively engage with your target audience.

13. Monitor Analytics and Gather Feedback Post-Launch
Track user engagement metrics and respond to feedback.
Detail: Use analytics tools (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.) to monitor app performance and user behavior. Reach out to users for feedback to incorporate into future updates.
Common Mistakes: Neglecting user feedback after the launch can stagnate app growth. Create a continuous feedback loop to enhance the user experience.

14. Plan for Future Updates
Based on data collected, outline a roadmap for future app versions.
Detail: Identify which features to implement next based on user demands and technology trends. Schedule periodic updates to keep users engaged.
Common Mistakes: Failing to maintain regular updates can lead to user attrition. Ensure to communicate upcoming features to maintain user interest.

15. Community Engagement and Support
Develop a community around your app for deeper user connection.
Detail: Create social media pages, forums, or user groups where users can interact, share experiences, and provide ongoing feedback.
Common Mistakes: Underestimating the power of community can hinder app development. Recognition and interaction with your user base can build loyalty and interest in the app.
